# BINARY SERACH APPLICATION
I have made this gui for my data structures mini project in sem2 which was based on the topic of binary search application.
I have used gui in python to build a dummy movie booking system for a theater / cinema .
It similar to book my show website.
Download all the images and copy the conents of py file and then run the py file and see how the gui works.
