# BINARY SERACH APPLICATION
I have made this gui for my data structures mini project in sem2 which was based on the topic of binary search application.
A gui in python used to build a dummy movie booking system for a theater / cinema .
It similar to book my show website.
Download all the images and copy the conents of py file and then run the py file and see how the gui works.
The most important function I have used here is binary search just go through the code once.
